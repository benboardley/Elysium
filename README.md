<h1>Elysium</h1>
<h2>New Generation Music Sharing Application</h2>
<h3>Founders</h3>
<p>Benjamin Boardley - Garrett Phillips - Jack Gardner</p>
  
<h3>Application Description</h3>
<p>The inspiration for this application initially comes from the argument of "What's better? Spotify or 
Apple Music?" We saw a divide between music lovers and wanted to find a way to connect them. Out 
of this, Elysium was born.</p>
<p>The goal of Elysium was to create a social music hub for users regardless of their streaming service. 
It aims to connect users through cross-compatible music sharing and friend connections. Our application
allows users to post text, song, album, and playlist-based content to share with friends. As of today, 
our app is deployed as a web application, and ideally will also be available for download on mobile 
platforms such as the iOS App Store and Andriod's Google Play store.</p>

<h3>Current Application Status</h3>
<p>We have released a beta version of our application available for web users, and plan to have version 1.0 
released by the start of 2025. It is our hope that this version will be available on mobile as well as web.</p>
<p>As of today, our application only allows Spotify users to connect and share content due to complications 
with the Apple Developer Program. Although, we hope to have Apple Music compatibility in our next beta release.</p>
